# Calculator

Welcome to the README file for the Calculator project! This project is a simple calculator application built using Python and the Tkinter library. In this document, you'll find an overview of the project, instructions on how to run the calculator, and a brief explanation of its features.

## Project Overview

The Calculator project aims to provide a basic calculator functionality through a user-friendly graphical interface. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The calculator also includes a clear button to reset the input fields.

## Requirements

To run the Calculator application, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system, along with the Tkinter library. Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations, so no additional installation steps are required.

## How to Run the Calculator

1. Clone this repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the calculator:

```shell
python calculator.py
```

4. The calculator application will launch, displaying the graphical user interface.
5. Use the number buttons to enter the desired numbers for the calculations.
6. Click on the arithmetic operation buttons to perform the corresponding operations.
7. The result will be displayed in the calculator's output field.
8. To clear the input fields and reset the calculator, click the "Clear" button.
9. Enjoy using the Calculator application!

## Features

The Calculator application offers the following features:

- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
- Input fields to enter numbers for calculations.
- Arithmetic operation buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Output field to display the result of the calculations.
- Clear button to reset the input fields.

## Additional Notes

- The application is built using Python's Tkinter library, which provides a simple way to create GUI applications.
- The code is organized into separate functions to handle different aspects of the calculator's functionality.
- Input validation is implemented to ensure the user enters valid numbers.
- The calculator follows the standard order of operations for performing calculations.
